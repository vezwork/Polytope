## About

Polytope is an experimental code editor that allows a user to write programs by embedding non-text editors (e.g. music notation editor, markdown editor, svg drawing tool, decision tree etc.) inline beside text in a text editor. The Polytope library provides utilities for constructing editors that work together and can be embedded in eachother. Polytope runs in the browser.

This repo contains **☣️research quality code☣️** (bad quality code) for the first and current version of Polytope. This version of Polytope may not be updated much in the future unless it receives community contributions. The idea of Polytope is not dead though, further experiments continue on
ideas underlying Polytope. I am no longer actively working on this repo, and my goal with Polytope is to enable people to write code in new ways, so I am open sourcing this repo in hopes it will help someone despite the poor code and documentation quality. Please [reach out](#community) if you have any questions.

## Try it out

## Running locally and contributing

The Polytope library is located in the lib folder, and is written in TypeScript.
See lib/README.md for simple instructions on how to build the lib.

index.html and custom.js contain the code that run an example usage of the Polytope library. They are probably
the best place to start. You can simply clone this repo and open index.html in your browser to try it out.
