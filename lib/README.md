## Building and running locally

1. Clone this repo to the folder of your choice.
2. Navigate to that folder in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`. This terminal window will now use Webpack to watch for any changes to files in
   `./src`. If you change a file, the project will automatically rebuild.
5. Open the folder in your file explorer.
6. Navigate to `./dist` and open index.html in your browser.
