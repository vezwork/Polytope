    // question: how to represent the caret being "inside" a slot
    // - let's think of a character as an example:
    //   - characters do not have an "inside": the caret can only be before or after a character.
    //   - If the start of the caret was before a character, and the end was after that character,
    //     then that could be considered inside. BUT then deleting would intuitively delete that
    //     entire character rather than the thing within it.
    //   - Given that counterexample to the before/after idea, I think there needs to be a way to
    //     recursively address a caret.
    // - Should it be possible for the caret start to be inside a slot while the caret's end is
    //   outside? YES, highting half a vector and half the equation it is in will not be possible.
    // - Caret start and end addresses can both use the same recursive addressing scheme, just
    //   with different addresses.
    // - It should be possible to look at a caret address and not need to know the size of a
    //   slot's "caret space" (the number of caret addresses within that slot, and the slots within
    //   it) which the caret is inside in order to tell where the start / end address of that slot
    //   is.
    // - So, a proposal for the caret address scheme is: 10.7.0 meaning that, in the slot
    //   at 10, there is a slot at 7, and in that slot the cursor is at 0. More meaningfully the
    //   the slot at 10 is between 10 and 11, just like the character "a" in the string "ab" is in
    //   between caret 0 and caret 1 (using traditional string caret addressing).
    // - A caveat of the above addressing scheme is that it doesn't include the widths of
    //   slots. Could this cause issues when highlighting? Well, the ordering of addresses is not a
    //   problem: addressess are unambiguously ordered e.g. 10.7.0 > 10.5.99 < 11 < 100.13.69
    // - Another caveat is that this may result in slots having to manage their own addressing. I
    //   would like slots to be able to easy ignore addressing. Slot address widths would affect how
    //   the left and right arrow behave: if a caret is at the end of a slot and the right arrow is
    //   pressed, then the caret would move out of the slot e.g. 46.9 -> right arrow -> 47. Slots
    //   should be able to prevent left/right arrow navigation out of the slot without setting a
    //   silly width.
    // - Implementation vs notation note: 44.69.7.0.1101 = [44, 69, 8, 0, 1101].
    // - Should slots be allowed to define their own addressing scheme? 2D slots would need a
    //   different addressing scheme.

    // - Yes actually i think slots should handle their own addressing. But then how does copy&paste
    //   work?
    //

    class ExampleElement extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
            // Always call super first in constructor
            super();

            // Create a shadow root
            this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
            this.shadowRoot.append(document.createTextNode('hello!'));
            this.style.color = 'blue';
        }
    }
    customElements.define('example-element', ExampleElement);
